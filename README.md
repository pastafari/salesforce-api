# salesforce-api

A Clojure library designed to talk to Salesforce via the REST API

## Installing
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.pastafari/salesforce-api/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.pastafari/salesforce-api)

## Usage
TODO: Write a way better README

Go forth and talk to Salesforce.

Use auth! to get an auth token, then pass it in to all the other CRUD methods

Note: I use this code in production, but I'm likely to make significant changes to
the API's in upcoming releases. So I would not recommend anyone else to use it, unless you know
what you're doing.

Expect a more stable version soon.
